# Solidity-Exercises
These are just a few functions that I've been practicing using in Solidity. I've been using the Remix IDE connected to my localhost(my computers file system with a 
dedicated folder just for Smart Contracts) for most of these exercises. The Remix IDE can be accessed online at url address: remix.ethereum.org  I am practicing 
Solidity as much as possible since I'm striving to be a Blockchain Developer. Thank you for checking out my repository and have a great day!
