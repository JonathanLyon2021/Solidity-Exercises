# Solidity-Exercises
These are just a few functions that I've been practicing using in Solidity. I've been using the Remix IDE connected to my localhost(my computers file system with a 
dedicated folder just for Smart Contracts) for most of these exercises. The Remix IDE can be accessed online at url address: remix.ethereum.org , copy any of this code 
in the repositiory and paste it into Remix IDE then complie it using complier versioon 0.8.0 or higher. I am practicing Solidity as much as possible since I'm striving 
to be a Blockchain Developer. I've found bits & peices of code from all over the internet and I'm using this repository to collaborate all my ideas into one spot in 
order to better my solidity skills using mapping, structs, arrays. and other data types. Thank you for checking out my repository and have a great day!
