// Generate a random number between 1 and 100:


//"encodePacked" types shorter than 32 bytes are concatenated directly, without padding or sign extension. Dynamic types are encoded in-place and without the length.

//What this would do is take the timestamp of now, the msg.sender, and an incrementing nonce 
//(a number that is only ever used once, so we don't run the same hash function with the same input parameters twice).
//It would then "pack" the inputs and use keccak to convert them to a random hash.
//Next, it would convert that hash to a uint, and then use % 100 to take only the last 2 digits. This will give us a totally random number between 0 and 99.

uint randNonce = 0;
uint random = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(now, msg.sender, randNonce))) % 100;
randNonce++;
uint random2 = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(now, msg.sender, randNonce))) % 100;
